This is a simple coin collection game I made in Unity.
You control a third-person pirate.
You have to move around the island and find the coins scattered around, whie avoiding the vikings (enemies).
The enemies attack you so you need to lure them away before collecting the coins.
Going into the sea slowly drains your health, so you need to get back onto the land.
You also have limited time to collect all the coins so you must hurry.
